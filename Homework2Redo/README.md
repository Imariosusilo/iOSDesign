Hey Tim,

This is my first redo for the second homework. I tried to apply the willShowKeyboard method. It doesn't seem to have any issue on the m. file but when I tested the build is crash and shows this message:

2014-06-28 18:25:33.375 Homework2Redo[49307:70b] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSUnknownKeyException', reason: '[<MainViewController 0x8c692e0> setValue:forUndefinedKey:]: this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key MainViewController.'
*** First throw call stack:

Can you please tell me what I did wrong.

Thank you
