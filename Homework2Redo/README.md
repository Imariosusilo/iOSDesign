Hey Tim,

Thanks for the tip, yesterday, it fixed the error. 

I'm stuck on the willHideKeyboard method. it seems the loginContainer and the signUpContainer doesnt want to go back to the original position after the keyboard is hidden. I double check the code and everything seems to be in the right place.

Can you tell me what is the problem

Thanks,
Imario
